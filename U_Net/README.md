<b>Yusuf</b>: Unforunately, for now, I'm unable to log into the Anaconda platform on RDIP, so I'm running this on an EIS server. This is working fine with regular tensorflow (no GPU) and keras. I'm making upgrades to this on the EIS server (which works for me), and will make a pull request to Sean's repo if I make any progress. Thanks
